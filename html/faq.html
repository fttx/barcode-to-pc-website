                    If you don't have access to a Wi-Fi network, you can always use your smartphone hotspot, by following this steps:

                <br> Note that Barcode to PC server doesn't require an internet connection, as matter of fact that it uses
                the LAN to communicate, thus, in most of the cases it is required only the Wi-Fi network.

                <p> You must add the Barcode to PC server executable to the firewall exceptions, and allow the connections for
                    the port 57891 TCP and 5353 UDP.<br> If you don't know how to do it, see the tutorial for your OS:

                <!-- Note that nowadays the majority of antivirus include also a built-in firewall, thus you must add Barcode to PC server to
                its exceptions list aswell. -->

                <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Add the server manually</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two ways to add the server manually.<br> The first is by using the QR Code:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the server</li>
                        <li>Click Info, and the connect QR Code should appear</li>
                        <li>Open the app</li>
                        <li>Open the menu and select the "Select server" page</li>
                        <li>Tap the scan icon [ ] and scan the QR Code</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br> The second one:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the server</li>
                        <li>Open the menu and select the "Select server" page</li>
                        <li>Tap the add icon + and type the IP address of the server</li>
                    </ol>


                    <!-- <li>Or if it doesn't work add the server manually by inserting </li>
                        <li>
                            If you're on Windows
                            <ol>
                                
                                <li>Press the Windows key (or open the Start menu)</li>
                                <li>Type <code>cmd</code></li>

                                <li>Search for <code>Default Gateway</code></li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Run the command <code>ifconfig if you're </code></li> -->
                </p>

                <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The app shows the "Connection problem" error</h3>
                <p> The most common cause of this issue is that the firewall and/or antivirus is blocking the communication between
                    the app and the server. See <a href="#configure-firewall">How do i configure my firewall?</a>

                <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Which port does the server use?</h3>
                Barcode to PC server runs a WebSocket server on the 57891 TCP port.<br> In addition to that, Barcode to PC
                server announces its service through the 5353 UDP port.<br><br> The latter is not essential, but it allows
                the app to discover the server without the user action. If you don't allow connections through the 5353 UDP,
                you can still use the server and the app, but you will need to <a href="#add-server-manually">add the server manually</a>

            <div class="col-md-offset-1">
                <h3><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> The server shows the "Apple Bonjour is missing" error</h3>
                This means that the installer has failed to install the <a href="https://support.apple.com/it-it/bonjour">Apple Bonjour package</a>                and this implies that the app may fail to detect the server automatically, and in order to connect the app
                you may need to <a href="#add-server-manually">add the server manually</a>.<br> To remove this alert and
                take advance of the zeroconf feature, try to install Barcode to PC server again with an administrator account
                and then reboot your system.
